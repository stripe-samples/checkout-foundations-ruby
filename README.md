# Stripe Checkout Foundations

[Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) creates a secure, Stripe-hosted payment page that lets you collect payments quickly. It works across devices and can help increase your conversion. Checkout makes it easy to build a first-class payments experience. 

## About this Repo
This repo corresponds to the Checkout integration built in the [Checkout 101 video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvQVPoRvbj0&list=PLy1nL-pvL2M5cO2i3lSYtwyqZh3EeGR9L).  The initial code is the code provided by the [Checkout Quickstart](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/quickstart) [Integration Builder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvQVPoRvbj0&list=PLy1nL-pvL2M5cO2i3lSYtwyqZh3EeGR9L). 

This repo differs slightly from the Integration Builder code:  

- The hard coded API key has been replaced with an environment variable.
- Calls to `Stripe.set_app_info` and `Stripe.api_version` have been added to `server.rb`.

## Running the code
1. Rename or copy  `.env.example` to `.env` and set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` to your test secret API key.   
2. Update the price id used in the `Stripe::Checkout::Session.create` in server.rb
3. Build the server

~~~
bundle install
~~~

4. Run the server

~~~
ruby server.rb
~~~

5. Visit [http://localhost:4242/checkout.html](http://localhost:4242/checkout.html) to start the Checkout flow.
